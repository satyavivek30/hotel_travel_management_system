# Hotel and Travel Management System

## Introduction
This project is a Hotel and Travel Management System developed in C++. It leverages object-oriented programming concepts to manage customer data and potentially handle functionalities like booking and reservations in a hotel or travel management context.

## Main Features
- **Customer Management**: Handles customer data, including details such as name, gender, address, age, and mobile number.
- **Data Storage**: Stores customer information in a file for persistent data management.
- **User Interface**: Provides a console-based interface for user interaction and data input.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:
- A C++ compiler (like GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- An IDE or text editor of your choice

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `main.cpp` file in your preferred IDE or text editor.
3. Compile and run the program using your C++ compiler.

For example, if you're using GCC, you can compile and run the program like this:
```bash
g++ -o hotel_system main.cpp
./hotel_system
'''

##** Usage**
Once the program is running, follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the system. The program allows you to manage customer details and access various features of the hotel and travel management system.

## **Program Overview**
The main.cpp file is the core of the application. It includes:

- Implementation of object-oriented programming concepts, particularly encapsulation.
- Classes such as ManageMenu for handling the user interface and Customers for managing customer data.
- Methods for capturing and storing customer information.
- A console-based menu system for navigating through different functionalities.
